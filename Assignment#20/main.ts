// Assignment # 20
// Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

// Storing a list of places in an array
let listOfPlaces : string[] = ["Germany", "Indus", "London", "Karachi", "France"];

//Printing list of places
listOfPlaces.forEach((place) => {
    console.log(place);
    
});
